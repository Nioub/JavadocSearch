Greasemonkey User Script: Javadoc Instant Search
================================================
By [Joël Thieffry], under [MIT licence].

This Greasemonkey script adds Instant Search function to Javadoc class frame.

Features
--------
* Three search pattern modes (choose in the selector):
 * Eclipse: search around capitals, for exemple ``NPException`` will show ``NullPointerException`` (as in the [Eclipse IDE] Java's type search).
 * Simplified: ``?`` to replace one character, ``*`` to replace any number of characters, for example ``N???P*Exception``.
 * Regex: for real men, use a plain regex here, for example ``^.*C(li)*p+$``.
* Pattern background becomes:
 * white if no pattern;
 * blue if active pattern;
 * red if error in pattern.
* Button to erase pattern.

Download
--------
* from the [Userscripts page]
* directly from [my website][zerezo-current]
* directly from [GitHub.com]
* fork it on the [GitHub page]

For use in [Mozilla Firefox], you need to install the [Greasemonkey plugin]. Unless the variable ``greasemonkey.fileIsGreaseable`` is set to true in your ``about:config``, the script won't run on local files.

In [Google Chrome], userscripts support is native since Chrome v4.

Timeline
--------

### Released [0.4 (2012/04/23)][current]
 * Fixed: heavy DOM manipulation caused massive slowdown and even stalled and crashed [Google Chrome]. As a side effect, also improved browser response.
 * Fixed: regexes (improper escaping and bad patterns).
 * Modified: Eclipse and Simplified search pattern modes are case-insensitive (as I found in [Eclipse IDE]).
 * Modified: code checked through the excellent [JSHint].

### Released [0.3 (2012/04/10)][v0.3]
 * Added: support for old javadoc versions (see Implementation details).
 * Fixed: minor fixes (set focus on startup only if successfully installed; new filename pattern).

### Released [0.2 (2012/04/05)][v0.2]
 * Fixed: simplified pattern mode was wrong interpreting ``?`` as "0 or 1 any character" instead of "1 any character".
 * Added: 200-millisecond delay between input in pattern box and search run; this improves responsiveness while typing a pattern.
 * Added: clicking on erase, or selecting of regex type, will then set focus on the pattern box.

### Released [0.1 (2012/04/03)][v0.1]
 * Initial version, written minimal documentation, uploaded to [userscripts.org][Userscripts] page.

Rationale
---------
I've just learned Javascript and DOM, this script is my first attempt to use it. I wanted to implement the efficient Eclipse search inside Javadoc.

There were three goals:

 1. A userscript for [Greasemonkey plugin] : done.
 2. A doclet extension: can't be done because a new doclet can't reuse standard doclet mecanism.
 3. A tool to insert the userscript into generated Javadoc : to be done.

Later, I found KOSEKI Kengo's script named [Javadoc Incremental Search]. This code and webpage inspired me (for example the embedded erase icon comes directly from it), but my implementation is really different: my code is simpler because it does less things.

Implementation details
----------------------

* I've found two formats of generated javadoc:

  * The modern hierarchy:

            html
              head
              body
                h1 (title)
                  div class="indexContainer"
                    ul (one for interfaces, one for classes)
                      li a (for every item)
                      ...

  * The old hierarchy:

            HTML
              HEAD
              BODY
                FONT B (title)
                BR
                TABLE
                  TR TD FONT
                    A BR (for every item)

  Given a corresponding page filename, if we find a div whose class is ``indexContainer`` then the modern hierarchy is assumed, otherwise we choose the old hierarchy (which is supported from v0.3).

* The search component is a paragraph whose id is ``javadocInstantSearchElement``. This id is looked for to avoid reinstalling the search component.

* The search component is added as a first child of the element whose class is ``indexContainer``.

* The regex transformation from Eclipse model to full regex follows these steps:
 1. Neutralize all special caracters: ``regex.replace(/([\\\^\$*+\[\]?{}.=!:(|)])/g, "\\$1")``.
 2. Prepend ``^.*`` and append ``.*$`` to allow search in any position.
 3. Prepend ``.*`` before all capital letters: ``regex.replace(/([A-Z])/g, "\.\*$1")``.

* All regexes are simplified using the following replaces:

        regex = regex.replace(/((.[\*\?])+)(?=\2)/g, "")  // Replace successive x* and x? to only one
                     .replace(/((.)\*\2\?)+/g, ".*")      // Replace x*x? with x*
                     .replace(/((.)\?\2\*)+/g, ".*")      // Replace x?x* with x*
                     .replace(/((.)\+\2\*)+/g, ".+")      // Replace x+x* with x+
                     .replace(/((.)\*\2\+)+/g, ".+")      // Replace x*x+ with x+
                     .replace(/((.[\*\?])+)(?=\2)/g, ""); // Replace successive x* and x? to only one
